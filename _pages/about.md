I'm a Ph.D. Candidate in Finance at School of Economics in Huazhong University of Science and Technology. My research focuses on financial econometrics, empirical asset pricing, and risk management. I'm passionate about developing and applying innovative econometrics tools to gain new insights by analyzing financial data, with particular focus on empirical asset pricing and risk management. I’m equally excited to bridge the deep learning technique with the empirical asset pricing, pushing the boundaries of how we predict and understand market behavior.
