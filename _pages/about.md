Hello, Iâ€™m Xinyu Wang, a Ph.D. Candidate in the School of Economics at Huazhong University of Science and Technology, where I am advised by Prof. Shaoping Wang. My research focuses on financial econometrics, empirical asset pricing, and risk management.

You can find my CV here: [Xinyu Wang's CV](../assets/CV_WXY.pdf).

**I am actively seeking postdoctoral opportunities starting in late 2025.**
