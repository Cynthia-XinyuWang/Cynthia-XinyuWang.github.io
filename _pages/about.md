I'm currently completing my Ph.D. in Economics at Huazhong University of Science and Technology. My research centers on financial econometrics, empirical asset pricing, and risk management. I'm passionate about developing and implementing econometrics tools to analyze financial market data and manage risk. Iâ€™m equally excited to bridge the deep learning technique with the empirical asset pricing, pushing the boundaries of how we predict and understand market behavior.

You can find my CV here: [Xinyu Wang's CV](../assets/CV_WXY.pdf).

**I am actively seeking postdoctoral opportunities.**
